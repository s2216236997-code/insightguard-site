  <!-- Title -->
  <h1>AI Governance Is About Determinism, Not Explainability</h1>
  <p class="meta">Published February 2026</p>

  <!-- Lead sentence -->
  <p class="lead">
    The real problem with AI governance is not that models are hard to explain — it’s that systems
    are allowed to change behavior without notice.
  </p>

  <!-- Problem framing -->
  <p>
    Most discussions around AI governance obsess over <em>explainability</em>.
    Why did the model say this? Which features mattered? Can we explain the reasoning step-by-step?
  </p>

  <p>
    These questions sound responsible — but they miss the operational failure mode.
    In production systems, governance does not break because teams cannot explain outputs.
    It breaks because <b>behavior drifts</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Models are retrained. Prompts evolve. Policies are “updated”. Dependencies change silently.
    And suddenly, the same input no longer leads to the same outcome.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <!-- Limits / failure mode -->
  <h2>Explainability Does Not Prevent Drift</h2>

  <p>
    Explainability is retrospective. It tells you <em>why something happened after the fact</em>.
    It does not guarantee that the same thing will happen again tomorrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    A perfectly explainable system can still change thresholds without notice, rename internal
    rules, introduce new edge cases, and behave differently across environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a governance perspective, this is catastrophic. Audits fail not because reasons are unclear —
    they fail because <b>behavior is unstable</b>.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <!-- Reframe -->
  <h2>Determinism Is the Real Governance Primitive</h2>

  <p>
    Infrastructure systems are governed by constraints, not explanations.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not ask databases to “explain” why they returned a row. We rely on the fact that queries
    are deterministic, schemas are versioned, and breaking changes are explicit.
    AI governance must work the same way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Determinism means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The same class of input produces the same class of decision</li>
    <li>Behavior changes only via version bumps</li>
    <li>Old versions remain valid and replayable</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Without this, no amount of interpretability can create trust.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Governance Fails When Behavior Is Not a Contract</h2>

  <p>
    Policy documents describe intent. Infrastructure enforces reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    If governance rules are not versioned, enumerable, and stable over time, then they are not
    governance — they are aspiration.
  </p>

  <p>
    True governance systems treat behavior as a <b>contract</b>, not a guideline:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Decisions are finite and known</li>
    <li>Reasons are enumerable and non-renamable</li>
    <li>Version changes are explicit events</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Anything else scales poorly under scrutiny.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>The Infrastructure View</h2>

  <p>
    Seen this way, explainability becomes secondary. Useful — yes. Foundational — no.
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundation is deterministic behavior, contracted semantics, auditable version history,
    and kill-switchable enforcement.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is why AI governance is infrastructure, not policy.
    And why systems that rely on documents instead of constraints will continue to fail — predictably.
  </p>
